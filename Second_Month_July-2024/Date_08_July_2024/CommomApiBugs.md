# Incorrect Response Status:
** Example: Imagine an API endpoint that should return a successful response (HTTP 200 OK) after creating a new user account. 
    However, due to a bug, it returns a 404 (Not Found) status instead.
** Impact: Users may encounter unexpected errors or fail to understand the actual outcome of their requests.

# Incorrect Parameters Handling:
** Example: Suppose an API expects a mandatory parameter (e.g., user_id) for retrieving user details. 
    If the parameter is missing or invalid, the API might return incorrect data or an error.
** Impact: Users receive inaccurate information or encounter unexpected behavior.

# Incorrect Response Data:
** Example: An API that retrieves product details should return relevant data (e.g., name, price, description). 
    If it returns outdated or incorrect information, users relying on that data may make wrong decisions.
** Impact: Misleading information affects user experience and business processes.

# Inconsistent Data Handling:
** Example: An API that fetches user preferences inconsistently (sometimes returning all preferences and other times only a subset) 
    can lead to unpredictable behavior for clients.
** Impact: Applications relying on consistent data may behave unexpectedly.

# Authentication Issues and Header Problems:
** Example: An API requiring an authentication token fails to validate it properly, 
    allowing unauthorized access.
** Impact: Security breaches, unauthorized data access, and potential data leaks.

# Functional Bugs:
** Example: An API endpoint meant to update user profiles accidentally deletes existing data instead of updating it.
** Impact: Data loss, user frustration, and potential legal issues.

# Performance Issues:
** Example: An API that performs poorly under high load (e.g., slow response times or frequent timeouts).
** Impact: Sluggish user experience, decreased productivity, and potential loss of customers.

# Security Vulnerabilities:
** Example: An API with SQL injection vulnerabilities allows attackers to manipulate database queries.
** Impact: Data breaches, unauthorized access, and compromised system integrity.
