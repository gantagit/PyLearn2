# âœ… 2. Triangle Classifier:
# Write a program that classifies a triangle based on its side lengths.
# Given three input values representing the lengths of the sides,
# determine if the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal),
# isosceles (exactly two sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal).
#
# Use an if-else statement to classify the triangle.
#
# 3 Input
# 	side 1, side 2 and side 3
# 	output - Eq, Iso, Scalene -
# 	Eq. = side 1 == side 2 = side 3
