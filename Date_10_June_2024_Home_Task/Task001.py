# 1) Explain the difference between = operator and == operator
# here = operator is used for assign a literal to a variable
a = float(input("Enter value for a : \n"))
b = float(input("Enter value for b : \n"))
# here == operator is used for comparison
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
else:
    print("a is not equal to b")

# 2) What does the ** operator do in python and how is it used
# Here ** is operator is used as power
print("a power of b is ", (a**b))
# the above line is similar to
# print("a power of b is ", math.pow(a,b))

# 3) What does the ^ operator do in python, and in what context is it commonly used
